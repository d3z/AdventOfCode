My solutions for the adventofcode.com puzzles

## Day one

The first part of this problem can be solved using a simple reduce. You are, after all, trying to reduce the list of commands into a single value.

For the second part, I just kept a count of iterations in my reduce and set the basement value to the current count as soon as the floor hit -1.

## Day two
A couple of simple maths puzzles today. My solutions can very likely be cleaned up quite a bit.
